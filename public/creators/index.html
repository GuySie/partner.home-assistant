              The creator network will be a group of creators that are active
              and engaged with our community with consistent content that builds
              the archive for Home Assistant. These creators are creating
              content for YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc. with the
              goal of helping people with Home Assistant. This can be through
              tutorials, unbiased product reviews, creating cool stuff and more.

              Will I get paid as a member of the creator network?

            <p>
              No. Creators are free to monetize their content wherever they
              operate. You can however get sponsored to talk about the Home
              Assistant Cloud in which payment for the ad will be given.
